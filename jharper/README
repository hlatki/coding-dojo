I hadn't used C++'s STL much lately, so that is what I
chose.

I decided to play some miniture "golf" in the
hand evaluator (poker.c).  This means I may have used
some bad practices to squeeze some lines out of the
code.  But I did not squeeze as hard as I could.  It
encodes the hand into a string that can be directly
compared to another hand's evaluation string.  The
single comparison even takes into account the high
card when there is a tie.  This string can actually
be encoded into a single int (it only requires 26
bits as is).

main.c was just hacked up to get it running.
