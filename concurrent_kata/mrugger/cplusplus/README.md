Functional C++
===

I used this Kata as a launchpad to explore the expression of functional ideas in C++.  This bit of code expresses only the most rudimentary of functional ideas, such as the immutability of objects and the use of recursion instead of loops.  Primitive stuff.

It gave me ideas of what a functional library for C++ might look like, which is something else I'm exploring.


**How to build**

The project uses a makefile and the compiler options used are for g++.

```$ make clean; make all```
